# Pull Request Guidelines
 
When creating a pull request, ensure it follows our standardized format as defined in @pull_request_template.md.
 
## Required Sections
 
### 1. What
Provide a clear and concise explanation of what changes are being introduced. This should give reviewers an immediate understanding of the scope of your changes.
 
To accurately identify all changes in your PR:
```bash
# Always use this command to see differences between your branch and develop
git fetch origin && git diff origin/main...HEAD | cat
```
This command:
- Fetches the latest changes from origin
- Shows differences between origin/develop and your current branch
- Uses `| cat` to display output directly without a pager
- The three dots (...) show changes that are in your branch but not in develop
 
### 2. Why
Explain the value and motivation behind these changes. This helps reviewers understand the business or technical context of your work.
 
### 3. How
Detail the technical implementation approach you took. Include:
- Key architectural decisions
- Any notable refactoring
- New dependencies introduced
- Potential impact areas
 
### 4. Jira Ticket
Always include a link to the corresponding Jira ticket for tracking purposes.
 
## Best Practices
